# LangChain RLHF Project

This project implements a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) application using LangChain. It includes tools for interacting with external APIs, setting up agents, managing model configurations, and storing feedback.

## Usage

- **Tools:** The `tourism_tools.py` file contains methods for checking hotel availability and retrieving weather information.
- **Agents:** The `agent_setup.py` file sets up the LangChain agent to interact with the defined tools.
- **Models:** The `model_config.py` file contains configurations for the models used in the RLHF project.
- **Feedback Storage:** The `firebase-credentials.py` file handles storing and retrieving feedback data in Firebase.
